# Introduction

Several groups in the ISO C++ Committee reviewed the "P1935: A C++ Approach to Physical Units"
[@P1935R2] proposal in Belfast 2019 and Prague 2020. All those groups
expressed interest in the potential standardization of such a library and encouraged further
work. The authors also got valuable initial feedback that highly influenced the design of
the V2 version of the [@MP-UNITS] library.

In the following years, the library's authors scoped on getting more feedback from the production
and design and developed version 2 of the [@MP-UNITS] library that resolves the issues raised
by the users and Committee members. The features and interfaces of this version are close to
being the best we can get with the current version of the C++ language standard.

This paper is authored by not only the [@MP-UNITS] library developers but also by the authors
of other actively maintained similar libraries on the market and other active members of
the C++ quantities and units community who have worked on this subject for many years.
We join our forces to say with one voice that we deeply care about standardizing such
features as a part of the C++ Standard Library. Based on our long and broad experience in
the subject, we agree that the interfaces we will provide in the upcoming proposals are
the best we can get today in the C++ language.

# About authors

## Dominik Berner

Dominik is a strong believer that the C++ language can provide very high safety guarantees when
programming through strong typing; a type error caught during compilation saves hours of
debugging. For the last 15 years, he has mainly coded in C++ and actively follows its evolution
through the new standards.

When working on regulated projects at Med-Tech, there usually were very tight requirements on
which data types were to be used for what, which turned out to be lists of primitives to be
memorized by each developer. However, throughout his career, Dominik spent way too many hours
debugging and fixing issues caused by these types being incorrect. In an attempt to bring
a closer semantic meaning to these lists, he eventually wrote [@SI_LIB] as a side project.

While [@SI_LIB] provides many useful features, such as type-safe conversion between physical
quantities as well as zero-overhead computation for values of the same units, there are some
shortcomings which would require major rework. Instead of creating yet another library,
Dominik decided to join forces with the other authors of this paper to push for standardizing
support for more type-safety for physical quantities. He hopes that this will eventually lead
to a safer and more robust C++ and open many more opportunities for the language.

## Johel Ernesto Guerrero Peña

Johel got interested in the units domain while writing his first hundred lines of game development.
He got up to opening the game window, so this milestone was not reached until years later.
Instead, he looked for the missing piece of abstraction,
called "pixel" in the GUI framework, but modeled as an `int`.
He found out about [@NHOLTHAUS-UNITS], and
got fascinated with the idea of a library that succinctly allows expressing his domain's units
(<https://github.com/nholthaus/units/issues/124#issuecomment-390773279>).

Johel became a contributor to [@NHOLTHAUS-UNITS] v3 from 2018 to 2020.
He improved the interfaces and implementations by remodeling them after `std::chrono::duration`.
This included parameterizing the representation type with a template parameter instead of a macro.
He also improved the error messages by mapping a list of types to an user-defined name.

By 2020, Johel had been aware of [@MP-UNITS] v0 `quantity<dim_length, length, int>`, put off by its
verbosity.
But then, he watched a talk by Mateusz Pusz on [@MP-UNITS].
It described how good error messages was a stake in the ground for the library.
Thanks to his experience in the domain, Johel was convinced that [@MP-UNITS] was the future.

Since 2020, Johel has been contributing to [@MP-UNITS].
He added `quantity_point`, the generalization of `std::chrono::time_point`, closing #1.
He also added `quantity_kind`, which explored the need of representing distinct quantities of the
same dimension.
To help guide its evolution, he's been constantly pointing in the direction of [@BIPM-VIM] as a
source of truth.
And more recently, to the ISO/IEC 80000 series, also helping interpret it.

Computing systems engineer.
(C++) programmer since 2014.
Lives at HEAD with C++Next and good practices.
Performs in-depth code reviews of familiarized code bases.
Has an eye for identifying automation opportunities, and acts on them.
Mostly at <https://github.com/JohelEGP/>.

## Charles Hogg

Chip Hogg is a Staff Software Engineer on the Motion Planning Team at Aurora Innovation, the
self-driving vehicle company that is developing the Aurora Driver.  After obtaining his PhD in
Physics from Carnegie Mellon in 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher and then staff scientist at
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), doing Bayesian data analysis. He joined
Google in 2012 as a software engineer, leaving in 2016 to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber's
Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), where he stayed until their acquisition by Aurora in 2021.

Chip built his first C++ units library at Uber ATG in 2018, where he first developed the concept of
unit-safe interfaces.  At Aurora in 2021, he ported over only the test cases, writing a new and more
powerful units library from scratch.  This included novel features such as vector space magnitudes,
and an adaptive conversion policy which guards against overflow in integers.

He soon realized that there was a much broader need for Aurora's units library.  No publicly
available units library for C++14 or C++17 could match its ergonomics, developer experience, and
performance.  This motivated him to create [@AU] in 2022: a new, zero-dependency units library,
which was a drop-in replacement for Aurora's original units library, but offered far more composable
interfaces, and was built on simpler, stronger foundations.  Once Au proved its value internally,
Chip migrated it to a separate repository and led the open-sourcing process, culminating in its
public release in 2023.

While Au provides excellent ergonomics and robustness for pre-C++20 users, Chip also believes the
C++ community would benefit from a standard units library.  For that reason, he has joined forces
with the mp-units project, contributing code and design ideas.

## Nicolas Holthaus

Nicolas graduated Summa Cum Laude from Northwestern University with a B.S. in  Computer Engineering.
He worked for several years at the United States Naval Air Warfare Center - Manned Flight Simulator -
designing real-time C++ software for aircraft survivability simulation. He has subsequently continued
in the field at various start-ups, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and most recently, STR (Science and
Technology Research).

Nicolas became obsessed with dimensional analysis as a high school JETS team member after learning
that the $125M Mars Climate Orbiter was destroyed due to a simple feet-to-meters miscalculation. He
developed the widely adopted C++ [@NHOLTHAUS-UNITS] library based on the findings of the 2002 white
paper "Dimensional Analysis in C++" by Scott Meyers. Astounded that no one smarter had already
written such a library, he continued with `units` 2.0 and 3.0 based on modern C++. Those libraries
have been extensively adopted in many fields, including modeling & simulation, agriculture, and
geodesy.

In 2023, recognizing the limits of `units`, he joined forces with Mateusz Pusz in his effort to
standardize his evolutionary dimensional analysis library, with the goal of providing the
highest-quality dimensional analysis to all C++ users via the C++ standard library.

## Roth Michaels

Roth Michaels is a Principal Software Engineer at
[Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com), a leading
manufacturer of audio, and music, software and hardware.  Working in
this domain, he has been involved with the creation of ad hoc typed
quantities/units for digital signal processing and GUI library
use-cases.  Seeing both the complexity of development and practical uses
where developers need to leave the safety of these simple wrappers
encouraged Roth to explore various quantity/units libraries to see if
they would apply to this domain.  He has been doing research into
defining and using digital audio and music domain-specific quantities
and units using first [@MP-UNITS] as proposed in [@P1935R2] and the new
V2 library described in this paper.

Before working for Native Instruments, Roth worked as a consultant in
multiple industries using a variety of programming languages.  He was
involved with the Swift Evolution community in its early days before
focusing primarily on C++ after joining
[iZotope](https://www.izotope.com) and now Native Instruments.

Holding a degree in music composition, Roth has over a decade of
experience working with quantities and units of measure related to
music, digital signal processing, analog audio, and acoustics.  He has
joined the [@MP-UNITS] project as a domain expert in these areas and to
provide perspective on logarithmic and non-linear quantity/unit
relationships.

## Mateusz Pusz

Mateusz got interested in the physical units subject while contributing to the [@LK8000]
Tactical Flight Computer Open Source project over 10 years ago. The project's code was far
from being "safe" in the C++ sense, and this is when Mateusz started to explore alternatives.

Through the following years, he tried to use several existing solutions, which were always
far from being user-friendly, so he also tried to write a better framework a few times from
scratch by himself.

Finally, with the availability of brand new Concepts TS in the gcc-7, the [@MP-UNITS] project
was created. It was designed with safety and user experience in mind. After many years
of working on the project, the [@MP-UNITS] library is probably the most modern and complete
solution in the C++ market.

Through the last few years, Mateusz has put much effort into building a community around physical
units. He provided many talks and workshops on this subject at various C++ conferences.
He also approached the authors of other actively maintained libraries to get their feedback
and invited them to work together to find and agree on the best solution for the C++ language.
This paper is the result of those actions.

## Vincent Reverdy

Vincent is an astrophysicist, computer scientist, and a member of the French delegation to
the ISO C++ Committee, currently working as a full researcher at the French National Centre
for Scientific Research (CNRS). He has been interested for years in units and quantities
for programming languages to ensure higher levels of both expressivity and safety in computational
physics codes. Back in 2019, he authored [@P1930R0] to provide some context of what could
be a quantity and unit library for C++.

After designing and implementing several Domain-Specific Language (DSL) demonstrators dedicated
to units of measurements in C++, he became more interested in the theoretical side of
the problem. Today, one of his research activities is dedicated to the mathematical formalization
of systems of quantities and systems of units as an interdisciplinary problem between physics,
mathematics, and computer science.


# Motivation

This chapter describes why we believe that quantities and units should be part of a C++ Standard
Library.

## Safety

It is no longer only the space industry or experienced pilots that benefit from the autonomous
operations of some machines. We live in a world where more and more ordinary people trust
machines with their lives daily. In the near future, we will be allowed to sleep while our
car autonomously drives us home from a late party. As a result, many more C++ engineers are
expected to write life-critical software today than it was a few years ago. However, writing
safety-critical code requires extensive training and experience, both of which are in short demand.
While there exists some standards and guidelines such as MISRA C++ [@MISRA_CPP] with the aim of
enforcing the creation of safe code in C++, they are cumbersome to use and tend to shift the burden
on the discipline of the programmers to enforce these. At the time of writing, the C++ language
does not change fast enough to enforce safe-by-construction code.


One of the ways C++ can significantly improve the safety of applications being written
by thousands of developers is by introducing a type-safe, well-tested, standardized way to handle
physical quantities and their units. The rationale is that people tend to have problems
communicating or using proper units in code and daily life. Numerous
expensive failures and accidents happened due to using an invalid unit or a quantity type.

The most famous and probably the most expensive example in the software engineering domain is
the Mars Climate Orbiter that in 1999 failed to enter Mars' orbit and crashed while entering
its atmosphere [@MARS_ORBITER]. This is one of many examples here. People tend to confuse units
quite often. We see similar errors occurring in various domains over the years:

- On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus unintentionally discovered the sea route from Europe
  to America because, during his travel preparations, he mixed the Arabic mile with a Roman mile,
  which led to the wrong estimation of the equator and his expected travel distance [@COLUMBUS].
- In 1628, a new warship, Vasa, accidentally had an asymmetrical hull (being thicker on the port side
  than the starboard side), which was one of the reasons for her sinking less than a mile into her maiden
  voyage, resulting in the death of 30 people on board. This asymmetry could have been caused by the
  use of different systems of measurement, as archaeologists have found four rulers used by the workers
  who built the ship. Two were calibrated in Swedish feet, which had 12 inches, while the other two
  measured Amsterdam feet, which had 11 inches [@VASA].
- Air Canada Flight 143 ran out of fuel on July 23, 1983, at an altitude of 41 000 feet
  (12 000 metres), midway through the flight because the fuel had been calculated in pounds
  instead of kilograms by the ground crew [@GIMLI_GLIDER].
- The British rock band Black Sabbath, during its Born Again tour in 1983, ordered a replica of Stonehenge
  as props for the scene. Unfortunately, they had to leave them in the storage area because, while
  submitting the order, their manager wrote dimensions down in meters when he meant feet, and so the
  stones didn't fit the scene. "It cost a fortune to make, but there was not a building on Earth that
  you could fit it into" [@STONEHENGE].
- On April 15, 1999, Korean Air Cargo Flight 6316 crashed due to a miscommunication between
  pilots about the desired flight altitude [@FLIGHT_6316].
- In February 2001, the crew of the Moorpark College Zoo built an enclosure for Clarence the Tortoise
  with a weight of 250 pounds instead of 250 kilograms [@CLARENCE].
- In December 2003, one of the roller coaster’s cars at Tokyo Disneyland’s Space Mountain attraction
  suddenly derailed due to a broken axle caused by confusion after upgrading the specification
  from imperial to metric units [@DISNEY].
- During the construction of the Hochrheinbrücke bridge to connect the small German town of Laufenburg
  with Swiss Laufenburg, the construction team made a sign error that resulted in a discrepancy
  of 54 cm between the two outer ends of the bridge [@HOCHRHEINBRÜCKE].
- An American company sold a shipment of wild rice to a Japanese customer, quoting a price of
  39 cents per pound, but the customer thought the quote was for 39 cents per kilogram [@WILD_RICE].
- On October 17, 2023, The Guardian published an article titled "Record Heat: Malawi swelters with
  temperatures nearly 68F above average" with many issues related to the affine space types and
  temperature units. Due to incorrect logic, probably during the translation of the article to
  the U.S.  market, `20 °C` above the average temperature was converted to `68 °F`. The actual
  temperature increase was `32 °F`, not `68 °F` [@THE_GUARDIAN].
- A whole set of [@MEDICATION_DOSE_ERRORS]...

The safety subject is so vast and essential by itself that we dedicated a separate paper [@P2981R0]
that discusses all the nuances in detail.

## Vocabulary types

We standardized many library features mostly used in the implementation details
(fmt, ranges, random-number generators, etc.). However, we believe that the most important
role of the C++ Standard is to provide a standardized way of communication between different
vendors.

Let's imagine a world without `std::string` or `std::vector`. Every vendor has their version
of it, and of course, they are highly incompatible with each other. As a result, when someone
needs to integrate software from different vendors, it turns out to be an unnecessarily arduous task.

Introducing `std::chrono::duration` and `std::chrono::time_point` improved the interfaces a lot,
but time is only one of many quantities that we deal with in our software on a daily basis.
We desperately need to be able to express more quantities and units in a standardized way so
different libraries get means to communicate with each other.

If Lockheed Martin and NASA could have used standardized vocabulary types in their interfaces, maybe
they would not interpret pound-force seconds as newton seconds, and the [@MARS_ORBITER] would
not have crashed during the Mars orbital insertion maneuver.

## Certification

Mission and life-critical projects, or those for embedded devices, often have to obey the safety norms
that care about software for safety-critical systems (e.g., ISO 61508 is a basic functional safety
standard applicable to all industries, and ISO 26262 for automotive). As a result, their company policy
often forbid third-party tooling that lacks official certification. Such certification requires
a specification to be certified against, and those tools often do not have one. The risk and cost
of self-certifying an Open Source project is too high for many as well.

Companies often have a policy that the software they use must obey all the rules MISRA provides.
This is a common misconception, as many of those rules are intended to be deviated from.
However, those deviations require rationale and documentation, which is also considered to be risky
and expensive by many.

All of those reasons often prevent the usage of an Open Source product in a company, which is a huge
issue, as those companies typically are natural users of quantities and units libraries.

Having the quantities and units library standardized would solve those issues for many
customers, and would allow them to produce safer code for projects on which human life depends every
single day.

## Complex and complicated

Suppose vendors can't use an Open Source library in a production project for
the above reasons. They are forced to write their own abstractions by themselves.
Besides being costly and time-consuming, it also happens that writing a quantities and units library
by yourself is far from easy. Doing this is complex and complicated, especially for engineers
who are not experts in the domain. There are many exceptional corner cases to cover that most
developers do not even realize before falling into a trap in production. On the other hand,
domain experts might find it difficult to put their knowledge into code and create a correct
implementation in C++.
As a result, companies either use really simple and unsafe numeric wrappers, or abandon the effort
entirely and just use built-in types, such as `float` or `int`, to express quantity values, thus losing
all semantic categorization. This often leads to safety issues caused by accidentally using values
representing the wrong quantity or having an incorrect unit.

## Extensibility

Many applications of a quantity and units library may need to operate on a combination of
standard (e.g. SI) and domain-specific quantities and units. The complexity of developing
domain-specific solutions highlights the value in being able to define new quantities
and units that have all the expressivity and safety as those provided by the library.

Experience with writing ad hoc typed quantities without library support
that can be combined with or converted to `std::chrono::duration` has
shown the downside of bespoke solutions: If not all operations
or conversions are handled, users will need to leave the safety of typed
quantities to operate on primitive types.

The interfaces of the [@MP-UNITS] library were designed with ease of extensibility in mind.
Each definition of a dimension, quantity type, or unit typically takes only a single line of
code. This is possible thanks to the extensive usage of C++20 class types as Non-Type Template
Parameters (NTTP). For example, the following code presents how second (a unit of time in the [@SI])
and hertz (a unit of frequency in the [@SI]) can be defined:

```cpp
inline constexpr struct second : named_unit<"s", kind_of<isq::time>> {} second;
inline constexpr struct hertz : named_unit<"Hz", 1 / second, kind_of<isq::frequency>> {} hertz;
```

## Broad industry value

When people think about industries that could use quantities and unit libraries, they think of
a few companies related to aerospace, autonomous cars, or embedded industries. That is all true,
but there are many other potential users for such a library.

Here is a list of some less obvious candidates:

- Manufacturing,
- maritime industry,
- freight transport,
- military,
- astronomy,
- 3D design,
- robotics,
- audio,
- medical devices,
- national laboratories,
- scientific institutions and universities,
- all kinds of navigation and charting,
- GUI frameworks,
- finance (including HFT).

As we can see, the range of domains for such a library is vast and not
limited to applications involving specifically physical units. Any
software that involves measurements, or operations on counts of some
standard or domain-specific quantities, could benefit from a zero-cost
abstraction for operating on quantity values and their units. The library
also provides affine space abstractions, which may prove useful in many
applications.

## Standardizing existing practice

Plenty of physical units libraries have been available to the public for many years. In 1998
Walter Brown provided an "Introduction to the SI Library of Unit-Based Computation" paper
for the International Conference on Computing in High Energy Physics [@CHEP98]. It emphasizes
the importance of strong types and static type-checking. After that, it describes a library
modeling the [@SI] to provide "strict compile-time type-checking without run-time overhead".

It also states that at this time, "in numeric programming, programmers make heavy, near-exclusive,
use of a language's native numeric types (e.g., `double`)". Today, twenty-five years later,
plenty of "Modern C++" production code bases still use `double` to represent various quantities
and units. It is high time to change this.

Throughout the years, we have learned the best practices for handling specific cases in the domain.
Various products may have different scopes and support different C++ versions. Still, taking that
aside, they use really similar concepts, types, and operations under the hood. We know how to do
those things already.

The authors of this paper developed and delivered multiple successful C++ libraries for this domain.
Libraries developed by them [have more than 90% of all the stars on GitHub in the field of
physical units libraries for C++](https://github.com/topics/dimensional-analysis?l=c%2B%2B).

The authors joined forces and are working together to propose the best quantities and units library
we can get with the latest version of the C++ language. They spend their private time and efforts
hoping that the ISO C++ Committee will be willing to include such a feature in the C++ standard
library.


# Design goals

The library facilities that we plan to propose in the upcoming papers is designed with
the following goals in mind.

## Compile-time safety

The most important property of any such a library is the safety it brings to C++ projects.
The correct handling of physical quantities, units, and numerical values should be verifiable both by
the compiler and by humans with manual inspection
of each individual line.

In some cases, we are even eager to prioritize safe interfaces over the general usability experience
(e.g. getters of the underlying raw numerical value will always require a unit in which the value should
be returned in, which results in more typing and is sometimes redundant).

More information on this subject can be found in [@P2981R0].

## Performance

The library should be as fast or even faster than working with fundamental types. The should
be no runtime overhead, and no space size overhead should be needed to implement higher-level
abstractions.

## Great user experience

The primary purpose of the library is to generate compile-time errors. If users
did not introduce any bugs in the manual handling of quantities and units, the library would be
of little use. This is why the library is optimized for readable compilation errors
and great debugging experience.

The library is easy to use and flexible. The interfaces are straight-forward
and safe by default. Users should be able to easily express any quantity and unit, which requires
them to compose.

The above constraints imply the usage of special implementation techniques. The library will not
only provide types, but also compile-time known values that will enable users to write easy
to understand and efficient equations on quantities and units.

## Feature rich

There are plenty of expectations from different parties regarding such a library. It should support
at least:

- Systems of Quantities.
- Systems of Units.
- Scalar, vector, and tensor quantities.
- The affine space.
- Natural units systems.
- Strong angular system.
- Any unit's magnitude (huge, small, floating-point).
- Faster-than-lightspeed constants.
- Highly adjustable text-output formatting.

## Easy to extend

Most entities in the library can be defined with a single line of code without
preprocessor macros. Users can easily extend provided systems with custom
dimensions, quantities, and units.

## Low standardization cost

The set of entities required for standardization should be limited to the bare minimum.

Derived units do not need separate library types. Instead, they can be obtained through the composition
of predefined named units. Units should not be associated with User-Defined Literals (UDLs), as it
is the case with `std::chrono::duration`. UDLs do not compose, have very limited scope and
functionality, and are expensive to standardize.

The user interface has no preprocessor macros.

It should be possible for most proposed features (besides text output) to be freestanding.


# Look and feel

_Note: The code examples presented in this paper may not exactly reflect the final interface
design that is going to be proposed in the follow-up papers. We are still doing some small
fine-tuning to improve the library._

So far, no papers have been submitted on a working interface of physical quantities and units.
To allow the reader to better understand the features and scope of the library, this chapter
presents a few simple examples.

## Basic quantity equations

Let's start with a really simple example presenting basic operations that every physical quantities
and units library should provide:

```cpp
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>

using namespace mp_units;
using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;

// simple numeric operations
static_assert(10 * km / 2 == 5 * km);

// unit conversions
static_assert(1 * h == 3600 * s);
static_assert(1 * km + 1 * m == 1001 * m);

// derived quantities
static_assert(1 * km / (1 * s) == 1000 * m / s);
static_assert(2 * km / h * (2 * h) == 4 * km);
static_assert(2 * km / (2 * km / h) == 1 * h);

static_assert(2 * m * (3 * m) == 6 * m2);

static_assert(10 * km / (5 * km) == 2 * one);

static_assert(1000 / (1 * s) == 1 * kHz);
```

Try it in [the Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/sYfoPzTvT).

## Hello units

The next example serves as a showcase of various features available in the [@MP-UNITS] library.

```cpp
#include <mp-units/format.h>
#include <mp-units/ostream.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/international/international.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/isq/isq.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace mp_units;

constexpr QuantityOf<isq::speed> auto avg_speed(QuantityOf<isq::length> auto d,
                                                QuantityOf<isq::time> auto t)
{
  return d / t;
}

int main()
{
  using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;
  using namespace mp_units::international::unit_symbols;

  constexpr quantity v1 = 110 * km / h;
  constexpr quantity v2 = 70 * mph;
  constexpr quantity v3 = avg_speed(220. * km, 2 * h);
  constexpr quantity v4 = avg_speed(isq::distance(140. * mi), 2 * isq::duration[h]);
  constexpr quantity v5 = v3.in(m / s);
  constexpr quantity v6 = value_cast<m / s>(v4);
  constexpr quantity v7 = value_cast<int>(v6);

  std::cout << v1 << '\n';                // 110 km/h
  std::cout << v2 << '\n';                // 70 mi/h
  std::println("{}", v3);                 // 110 km/h
  std::println("{:*^14}", v4);            // ***70 mi/h****
  std::println("{:%Q in %q}", v5);        // 30.5556 in m/s
  std::println("{0:%Q} in {0:%q}", v6);   // 31.2928 in m/s
  std::println("{:%Q}", v7);              // 31
}
```

## Bridge across the Rhine

The following example codifies the history of a famous issue during the construction of a bridge across
the Rhine River between the German and Swiss parts of the town Laufenburg [@HOCHRHEINBRÜCKE].
It also nicely presents how [the Affine Space is being modeled in the library](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/latest/users_guide/framework_basics/the_affine_space/).


```cpp
#include <mp-units/ostream.h>
#include <mp-units/quantity_point.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/isq/space_and_time.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace mp_units;
using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;

## Storage tank

This example estimates the process of filling a storage tank with some contents. It presents:

- [The importance of supporting more than one distinct quantity of the same kind](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/systems_of_quantities/#system-of-quantities-is-not-only-about-kinds),
- [faster-than-lightspeed constants](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/faster_than_lightspeed_constants/),
- how easy it is to [add custom quantity types](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/systems_of_quantities/#defining-quantities)
when needed, and
- [interoperability with `std::chrono::duration`](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.1/users_guide/framework_basics/concepts/#QuantityLike).

## User defined quantities and units

Users can easily define new quantities and units for domain-specific
use-cases.  This example from digital signal processing will show how to
define custom units for counting
[digital samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing))
and how they can be converted to time measured in milliseconds:

```cpp
#include <mp-units/format.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/isq/isq.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>
#include <format>

namespace dsp_dsq {

using namespace mp_units;

inline constexpr struct SampleCount : quantity_spec<dimensionless, is_kind> {} SampleCount;
inline constexpr struct SampleDuration : quantity_spec<isq::time> {} SampleDuration;
inline constexpr struct SamplingRate : quantity_spec<isq::frequency, SampleCount / isq::time> {} SamplingRate;

inline constexpr struct Sample : named_unit<"Smpl", one, kind_of<SampleCount>> {} Sample;

namespace unit_symbols {
inline constexpr auto Smpl = Sample;
}

}

int main()
{
  using namespace dsp_dsq::unit_symbols;
  using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;

  const auto sr1 = 44100.f * Hz;
  const auto sr2 = 48000.f * Smpl / s;

  const auto bufferSize = 512 * Smpl;

  const auto sampleTime1 = (bufferSize / sr1).in(s);
  const auto sampleTime2 = (bufferSize / sr2).in(ms);

  const auto sampleDuration1 = (1 / sr1).in(ms);
  const auto sampleDuration2 = dsp_dsq::SampleDuration(1 / sr2).in(ms);

  const auto rampTime = 35.f * ms;
  const auto rampSamples1 = value_cast<int>((rampTime * sr1).in(Smpl));
  const auto rampSamples2 = value_cast<int>((rampTime * sr2).in(Smpl));

  std::println("Sample rate 1 is: {}", sr1);
  std::println("Sample rate 2 is: {}", sr2);

  std::println("{} @ {} is {}", bufferSize, sr1, sampleTime1);
  std::println("{} @ {} is {}", bufferSize, sr2, sampleTime2);

  std::println("One sample @ {} is {}", sr1, sampleDuration1);
  std::println("One sample @ {} is {}", sr2, sampleDuration2);

  std::println("{} is {} @ {}", rampTime, rampSamples1, sr1);
  std::println("{} is {} @ {}", rampTime, rampSamples2, sr2);
}
```

The above code outputs:

```text
Sample rate 1 is: 44100 Hz
Sample rate 2 is: 48000 Smpl/s
512 Smpl @ 44100 Hz is 0.01161 s
512 Smpl @ 48000 Smpl/s is 10.6667 ms
One sample @ 44100 Hz is 0.0226757 ms
One sample @ 48000 Smpl/s is 0.0208333 ms
35 ms is 1543 Smpl @ 44100 Hz
35 ms is 1680 Smpl @ 48000 Smpl/s

# Scope

The tables below briefly highlight the expected scope and feature set. Each of the features will
be described in detail in the upcoming papers. To learn more right away and to be able to provide
early feedback, we encourage everyone to check out the documentation of the [@MP-UNITS] project.

_Note: The priorities provided in the below tables are the recommendations by authors based on their
experience in the domain, but are in no way final. This is just an entry point for the discussion
in the Committee._

## Core framework

The features in this chapter are intended to be provided in the same ISO proposal (possibly in
a few steps).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

In the above table:

- `std::quantity` is a class template that is the workhorse of the library.
  It is an incompatible generalization of `std::chrono::duration`.
- Expression templates are used to provide user-friendly error messages and great debugging experience.
  More information on this subject can be found in [@P2982R0].
- Quantity specifications include at least the following information: quantity type, quantity character,
  quantity equation (in case of derived quantities), quantity kind, and dimension.
- References (temporary name to be bikeshedded) are numeric wrappers over a quantity specification and
  a unit.
- `std::quantity_point` is an incompatible generalization of `std::chrono::time_point`.
- Absolute point origin is a compile-time constant defining an absolute origin for `std::quantity_point`
  of a specific quantity type.
- Relative point origin is a compile-time constant defining an origin relative to another point origin.

Below, we provide a short overview of estimated additional framework-related costs associated with
providing support for the following features (based on our current implementation experience):

- Quantity kinds
    - `is_kind` tag type
    - additional conversion rules to improve safety
- Quantities of the same kind
    - `kind_of<QS>` class and variable templates
    - additional conversion rules to improve safety
    - `common_quantity_spec()` function that finds a common node in the hierarchy tree
- Vector and tensor representation types
    - `quantity_character` enum
    - `is_scalar<T>`, `is_vector<T>`, `is_tensor<T>` customizations points
    - a few concepts (e.g. `RepresentationOf<Ch>`, `VectorRepresntation<T>`, ...)
- Logarithmic units
    - the design is TBD
- Natural units
    - `system_reference` class template
- Polymorphic unit
    - the design is TBD

_Note 1:_ There is no built-in support to output `quantity_point` as text.

_Note 2:_ As long as the C++ Standard doesn't provide a generic facility to parse localized text,
we do not plan to propose any support for doing that for physical quantities and their units.

## Systems of quantities

The features in this and the following chapters are intended to be provided in separate ISO proposals
that will be independently discussed and considered for standardization.

## External dependencies

The features in this chapter are heavily used in the library, but are not domain-specific.
Having them standardized (instead of left as exposition-only) could not only improve
the specification of this library, but also could serve as an important building block for tools
in other domains that we can get in the future from other authors.

# Plan for standardization

Having quantities and units support in C++ would be extremely useful for many C++ developers,
and ideally, we should ship it in C++29. We believe that it can be done, and we propose a plan
to get there. The plan below is, of course, not an irrevocable commitment. If things get delayed
or controversial for whatever reason, quantities and units (or some parts of it)
will miss the train and we will have to wait three more years. However, having a clear plan approved
by LEWG will help to keep the efforts on track.
